    Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Slate, Stone, Amber)
    Application Structure Plan: The application uses a top-level navigation to select the primary context: the Grade Band (High School, Middle School, etc.). This choice immediately filters the entire view. Below this, a secondary filter allows users to isolate sessions by one of the five "Big Ideas." The sessions themselves are presented as cards in a responsive grid, which is more scannable and mobile-friendly than a long table. This layered filtering approach was chosen because it mirrors the curriculum's natural hierarchy (Grade -> Topic -> Session) and allows educators to easily compare grade levels or trace a single concept (like "Learning") through the different stages of development, which is a primary user goal. A dynamic donut chart provides a quick visual summary of the curriculum's structure.
    Visualization & Content Choices: 
    - Report Info: Hierarchical curriculum plan. Goal: Make the plan explorable and comparable across grade levels. Viz/Presentation Method: Interactive Cards created with HTML/CSS. Interaction: JavaScript functions to filter and render cards based on user-selected grade band and "Big Idea" filters. Justification: Cards are ideal for presenting discrete chunks of structured text content. Filtering provides a powerful way to navigate the dense information without scrolling.
    - Report Info: Thematic breakdown of sessions (5 Big Ideas). Goal: Provide a high-level visual summary of the curriculum's structure for a selected grade band. Viz/Presentation Method: Donut Chart. Interaction: The chart dynamically updates via JavaScript whenever the user selects a new grade band. Justification: A donut chart offers an immediate, easy-to-understand visual breakdown of the session categories. Library/Method: Chart.js, rendered on a Canvas element.
    CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used.
